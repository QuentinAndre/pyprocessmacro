# Understanding `Process` outputs. 

In general the process has a _pretty printed_ output wich shows the ananlysis that you will need. However, if you are looking for the actual data tables or specific outputs, those are available as well. 

```
p = Process(data=df, model=13, x=x, y=y, w=w, m=m, z=z)

df[x, y, w, m, z]
```
